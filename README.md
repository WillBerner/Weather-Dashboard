# Weather-Dashboard

A web application for viewing weather forecasts. Built using Javascript and JQuery, with weather data pulled from the OpenWeatherMap API and styling from Bootstrap.

Users are presented with a dashboad to view the current weather as well as a five day future forecast for a particular location. When reloading the page, the user's most recently searched location will default as the location loaded. Displays information about the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and type of weather (cloudy, sunny, rainny, etc).
